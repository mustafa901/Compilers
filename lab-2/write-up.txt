• Across this lab, what was the most difficult aspect? How did you overcome it?
An\ I think that trying to work around some of the math logic when it comes to converting it in a language that the 
program understands seemed to be a more difficult tast than I though but I was able to utilize geeksforgeeks to understand some of the logic conversion.

• We handle negative numbers in our grammar and not in the lexer. Why is this?
An\ Because the Negative sign is related more to the logic of the application, not in the lexer where the syntax is mainly analyzed.

• In class, we had to define certain operators as “left associative”. What does this mean and why didn’t we have to do it in this lab?
An\ Left associativity indicates that certain operators appear in sequence, and we have already declared left associativity in the begining of the bison file
